# Fresh + Sanity Demo

This is a demo of using [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) with [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).

It includes a skeleton Sanity Studio using v3 for you to create your own.

### Usage

Start the fresh server:

```
cd fresh

deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
